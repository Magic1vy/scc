                    <p class="par">Smart Club since 2018 was originally established as a private goal-setting club in Toronto by amazing and very intelligent girl Elena Kosenko. However, in 2021 she moved to California and passed the club to Mila Bogorodovska. After that the club started to expand its membership and we organized more than 100 events in Toronto. Our most famous events include White Parties on a 100ft Sailing Boat, vine tours in castles, and fun networking events. If you want to participate in our events you can simply DM us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/smartclub_canada/" target="_blank"> Instagram </a>  fill out the form <a href="#member">here</a>. <br>
                    Since 2021, we have welcomed over 250 women to our events. During this time, we have also collaborated with numerous companies and individuals who wanted to promote their services. If you're looking to expand the reach of your business and increase its visibility, we would be delighted to explore potential collaboration opportunities with you. To begin the conversation, simply reach out to us via <a href="mailto:smartclubcanada@gmail.com">email</a> , and we can schedule a time to discuss how we can work together to achieve our respective goals. We look forward to the possibility of building a mutually beneficial partnership with you.</p>

She also holds an MSc in Mathematics. As an international model, Mila has traveled across the globe and lived and worked in 17 countries, including cities like Milan, New York, Paris, Miami, Istanbul, and Mexico City. She has been featured on over 20 magazine covers and inside notable publications such as Vogue Italy, Women's Health, and L'Officiel, to name a few. Mila is passionate about solving problems, piecing together customers' problems with relevant solutions through discovery, analysis, and intuition. That's why she smoothly transitioned into a business development career for companies in FinTech five years ago. Mila believes that everything is possible and has always been interested in self-development. She became a Reiki master and finished certain schools where she learned how to work with energy to make sure goals will come true. This led to her coaching business owners from 2016-2018. Now, some of those techniques are used during SCC meetings. Mila is married and raising a son.</p>

These events take place in restaurants or event facilities in Toronto and often feature an exciting activity or a guest speaker. We make sure each meeting is a learning opportunity, a chance to connect and have fun. We talk about investment, art, healthy habits, new business opportunities, and much more.
                <br>In addition to our monthly meetings, we also organize retreats and mini-trips to beautiful destinations like Niagara on the Lake or Lavender Farms. We love to celebrate special occasions too, whether it's Women's Day or the start of summer. Also, we do different creative workshops like painting or making Christmas Arrangements.

                <p class="par">For instance, every summer, we host a White Party on a 100 ft boat that sails from downtown Toronto to the Islands. It's a great opportunity to combine sailing with a fun party atmosphere. Last year, we had a spectacular fashion show on the boat, featuring the clothing brand Moon Rivers Fashion. Our guests were able to become models and showcase beautiful dresses. We also had feminine dancing sessions, mini photoshoots, and delicious snacks, making it four hours of pure enjoyment.</p>
